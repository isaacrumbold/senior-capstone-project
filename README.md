# senior-capstone-project

## Introduction

This was my capstone project that I completed for my senior year in the spring of 2023. Attached are the .ts files that have all the functionality needed to make this project run accordingly. I had a lot of fun with this one. It required a lot of problem solving and additions to the project as time went along.

## Project Scope

The make pretend business context that I created for this project was that a local company (Tremont, IL) involved in the agriculture industry had created a device that allowed for rapid soil tests that people could use to test their gardens soil. They needed an application that would display the results to the users. They also had a list of plants with their preferred pH ranges. The user should also be able to select which plants would be in there garden and the application would display a graph with that data.

#### Project Goals

One of the main things I wanted to learn while creating this project was how a hash function and class worked. So, I did a little research to understand just how creating these two things work and I created my own hash class and function in the file hash.ts. I also utilized a charting library called chart.js to create the charts once the plants were selected.

## Interacting with the project

Lastly, here are a few things to not when interacting with this repo. You can pull this repo and will need to run yarn to install all the needed dependencies. With that be sure that you have a current version of Node.js installed. Lastly you will have to run the tsc command to compile the .ts files to .js and then you can run the server with the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

## Closing

This was definitely a learning project for sure and looking back there are a few things I would have done differently but overall it was enjoyable to create my own hash function and class as well as design a UI. Thanks for checking my project out!
